# DAY-4
I am Jaskiran kaur from department of 'COMPUTER SCIENCE ENGINEERING'.
today is the first day of topic HARDWARE. 
in this topic we learn about the hardware system of computer. including mother board, cash memory, HDD (hard-disk drive), ROM (randoM acess memory) ,ROM (read only memory), C-mouse, HDD (hard-disk drive), rigestories, DVD drive, floppy disk, Power supply, cooling fan, and so on.

here is the explaination of these hardware parts:
1. MOTHER BOARD: A motherboard is the central printed circuit board (PCB) in a computer system. It's often called the "mainboard," "system board," or informally, "mobo," because it acts as the foundation that connects and allows communication between all the crucial electronic components.
Think of it as the backbone, nervous system, and circulatory system of a computer, all in one. It physically supports components, acts as a control center for data, and distributes power from the power supply unit (PSU).

2. RAM, or Random Access Memory, is a crucial component in any computer system, from desktops and laptops to smartphones and gaming consoles. It serves as your computer's short-term memory, providing a lightning-fast workspace for the CPU (Central Processing Unit) to store and access data that it needs right now.

3. ROM, which stands for Read-Only Memory, is a type of computer memory that holds non-volatile data. This means that unlike RAM, the data stored in ROM remains even when the power is turned off.

4. C-MOUSE: , it commonly refers to a mouse that utilizes a USB-C connection.
5. HDD: or Hard Disk Drive, is a traditional electro-mechanical data storage device that stores and retrieves digital data using magnetic storage. It's the primary long-term, non-volatile storage component in many computers.

6. DVD DRIVE: A DVD drive, also known as an optical disc drive (ODD), is a computer hardware component that uses a laser to read data from and (in many cases) write data to Digital Versatile Discs (DVDs). These drives are an evolution of earlier CD (Compact Disc) drives and were once a ubiquitous part of personal computers.

7. FLOPPY DISK: The floppy disk, often just called a "floppy" or "diskette," is a classic example of removable magnetic storage media. For decades, from the 1970s through the early 2000s, it was the go-to method for saving and transferring data between computers. Today, it's largely obsolete, replaced by much faster and higher-capacity storage solutions.

8. CPU: The CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is often referred to as the "brain" of a computer. It's the primary component responsible for carrying out the instructions of a computer program, performing basic arithmetic, logical, control, and input/output (I/O) operations. Essentially, it interprets and executes almost all the instructions that make your computer work.
Every single action you perform on a computer, from typing on a keyboard and opening an application to Browse the internet and playing a game, involves the CPU processing instructions and data.
  in this hardware type CPU,  we learn about the parts of cpu:

in this diagram cpu socket is like a sandwich fits in cpu system:

9. REGISTERIES: In the context of Windows operating systems, the Windows Registry is a hierarchical database that stores low-level settings and configurations for the operating system, applications, hardware devices, and user preferences.

10. CACHE MEMORY: Cache memory, often just called "cache," is a small, very fast type of volatile computer memory that serves as a high-speed buffer between the CPU (Central Processing Unit) and the main memory (RAM). Its primary "work" is to speed up data access for the CPU, thereby significantly enhancing the overall performance of the computer system.
    why is cache memory needed?
    The CPU operates at incredibly high speeds (nanoseconds), while main memory (RAM) is significantly slower (tens of nanoseconds). This speed mismatch creates a bottleneck:      the CPU often has to wait for data to be fetched from RAM, leading to wasted cycles and reduced performance.

then we disscus about size of CD/DVD:

     CD - 700mb  
     
     DVD - single layer - 4.7gb
     
     DVD - double layer - 8.5gb
     
     BD - single layer - 25gb - advanced disk
     
     BD - double layer - 50gb
